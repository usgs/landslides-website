<p>Landslides related to snowmelt and heavy rainfall cause widespread property damage and occasional loss of life.  In recent years, the Landslide Hazards Program has conducted research on precipitation-induced landslides in selected areas of California, Colorado, Oregon, Virginia, and Washington.  The research includes field investigations, monitoring, modeling and analysis.  USGS research on precipitation-induced landslides has focused mainly on developing predictive understanding of where and when landslides are likely to occur.  Some effort is also being devoted to understanding how far landslides will travel and how large they will be.  The following links and references provide information about and results of recent and ongoing USGS research on precipitation-induced landslides.</p>
