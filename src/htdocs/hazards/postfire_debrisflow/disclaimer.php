    The hazard assessments use a design rainstorm with a given peak 15-minute
    rainfall intensity to predict the probability, volume, and combined
    relative hazard of debris flows in basins burned by the fire. Differences
    in model predictions and actual debris-flow occurrence will arise with
    differences in actual storm duration and intensity. The occurrence of higher
    rainfall intensities or longer storm durations may increase the probability
    or volume of potential debris flows.

    In addition, this hazard assessment relies upon readily available geospatial
    data, the accuracy and precision of which may influence the estimated
    likelihood and magnitude of post-fire debris flows. However, local
    conditions (such as debris supply) certainly influence both the probability
    and volume of debris flows. Unfortunately, locally specific data are not
    presently available at the spatial scale of the post-fire debris-flow hazard
    assessment. As such, local conditions that are not constrained by the model
    may serve to dramatically increase or decrease the probability and(or)
    volume of a debris flow at a basin outlet. The input geospatial data are
    also subject to error based upon mapping resolution, elevation interpolation
    techniques, and mapping and(or) classification methods. Finally, this
    assessment is specific to debris-flow hazards; hazards from flash-flooding
    are not described in this study and may be significant.

    This assessment also characterizes potential debris-flow hazards at a static
    point in time immediately following wildfire. Studies of post-fire debris
    flows in the western United States have indicated that debris-flow activity
    in recently burned areas typically occurs within 2 yr of wildfire. As
    vegetation cover and soil properties return to pre-fire conditions, the
    threat of debris-flow activity decreases with time elapsed since wildfire.
    Conversely, the hazards from flash-flooding may persist for several years
    after wildfire.

    The assessment is provided on the condition that neither the U.S.
