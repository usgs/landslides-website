  <p>
    Post-fire debris-flow hazard assessments for recently burned areas in the
    western United States are provided free to any interested Federal, State,
    or Local Agency, or to any private organization, company or individual.
    These assessments rely upon field-validated estimates of soil burn severity
    in geospatial format. These data should be provided at the time of the
    request.
  </p>
  <p>
    Due to limitations in the model, we may not be able to accommodate requests
    for assessments in certain burn areas, such as those  with very low relief
    terrain, very small burn areas, or in areas that are outside of the western
    United States.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please direct your requests, or any questions you may have regarding the
    assessment process, to:

    previously been requested, though we strive to respond to any request
    within 3 business days.
