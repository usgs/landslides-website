<p><strong>What do the maps mean?</strong></p>
<p>
  The maps depict the likelihood and potential volume of debris flows as they exit the mountain front in response to a design storm having a 15-minute peak rainfall intensity of 24 mm/h. The models are designed to assess the potential for debris flow in the locations where debris flows initiate (i.e., where they form and get larger).
</p>

<p><strong>Do the maps show where debris flows will travel?</strong></p>
<p>
  No, the maps do not identify debris-flow runout paths, areas of inundation, or assess potential damage. Modeling debris-flow runout is very challenging, especially in populated areas, and developing predictive runout tools is an active area of USGS research.
</p>
<p><strong>Itâ€™s been a couple of months since the fire, will the maps be updated?</strong></p>
<p>
  No, the maps only depict the hazard immediately after the fire. But the danger goes down over time as vegetation regrows and the soil recovers. In general, the debris-flow hazard remains elevated for 2-5 years after a wildfire. Precisely how long the danger lasts depends on many factors, such as how much it rains and how severely the slopes were burned. Quantifying the change in debris-flow hazard as the burned area recovers is an active area of USGS research.
</p>
<p><strong>What is the meaning 15-minute peak intensity of 24 mm/h?</strong></p>
<p>
  A 15-minute rainfall intensity of 24 mm/h is equivalent to the accumulation of 6 mm of rain in 15 minutes. In English units, this is equivalent to approximately 1/4 of an inch of rain in 15 minutes.
</p>
<p><strong>Why use a 15-minute peak intensity of 24 mm/h design storm?</strong></p>
<p>
  This design storm is used for three reasons:
  <ol>
    <li>
      Post-fire debris flows are most often triggered by high-intensity, short-duration bursts of rain.
    </li>
    <li>
      A 24 mm/h rain burst is likely to happen in most areas of the western U.S. (i.e. a 1-5 year recurrence interval).
    </li>
    <li>
      A 24 mm/h rain burst is known to trigger debris flows at USGS monitoring sites in burn areas.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p><strong>Are results for other storm scenarios available?</strong></p>
<p>
  Yes, other design storms are contained in the geospatial data available for download. These storms have peak 15-minute intensities ranging from 12 to 40 mm/h in 4 mm/h increments.
</p>
<p><strong>How do I get a post-fire debris flow hazard assessment?</strong></p>
<p>See Assessment Requirements page.</p>

<p><strong>I live near a recently burned area. Am I in danger?</strong></p>
